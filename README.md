PulloverJS
==========

PulloverJS provides a web page overlay, to ensure user interaction back
pressure, in the case that services fail to respond in a timely fashion.

PulloverJS is a good solution for web application eco systems, that
require a high level of service availability and embrace _fail-fast_,
since it can be easily used across multiple apps.

## Work in progress!
